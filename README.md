# What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). It is designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Unlike traditional relational databases (like MySQL or PostgreSQL), MongoDB doesn't rely on tables, rows, and columns. Instead, it uses collections  and documents (tables and rows in SQL).
